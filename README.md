<h1 align="center" id="title">Bookshelf</h1>

An Android app that makes multiple requests to a web service and displays a list of books with images from the Google Books API. Created for demo purposes to demonstrate everything I learned within the "Android Basics with Compose" Course (Unit 5). Built fully with Jetpack Compose.
